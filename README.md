#### The Game
Based on the popular game [CandyCrush](https://king.com/play/candycrush), this implementation also features drag-and-drop and score tracking. Players can also change the size of the board by adding a size parameter to the URL (minimum size 3, maximum size 20). By default, the board size is set to 8 candies on a side.
